 # ReadMe Generator 
 [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

 ## Description
This project is a simple commandline tool that allows a user to generate a quality README.md file by customizing a premade template with input. Users will be prompted to share a project name, a description, contribution guidelines, installation instructions, test examples and the option to choose from three popular licenses(or none at all). A section is also provided for a user to provide contact information in the form of a Github account and email address. This application can greatly simplify the process of creating decent README files, or provide a very strong starting point.
