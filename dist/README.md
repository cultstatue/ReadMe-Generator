  # README Generator
  

  ## Description
  This project is a simple commandline tool that allows a user to generate a quality README.md file by customizing a premade template with input. Users will be prompted to share a project name, a description, contribution guidelines, installation instructions, test examples and the option to choose from three popular licenses(or none at all). A section is also provided for a user to provide contact information in the form of a Github account and email address. This application can greatly simplify the process of creating decent README files, or provide a very strong starting point.
